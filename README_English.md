This article provides a hands-on tutorial for running the ****GraphCast****.

Simply click the Jupyter button "Run All," and the code will automatically execute the model's environment installation and operation, perform automatic inference, and demonstrate how to train the model (refer to "III. Running GraphCast from a New Environment" - "5. Run GraphCast"). Depending on the machine, executing all the code may take several minutes to a dozen minutes.

The translated and debugged official ****Jupyter**** example is as follows:

## I. Introduction to GraphCast

GraphCast is a weather forecasting system based on machine learning and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). The system has been tested by meteorological agencies, including the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). It is an advanced artificial intelligence model capable of mid-term weather forecasting with unprecedented accuracy. GraphCast can forecast weather conditions up to 10 days in advance, more accurate and faster than the industry's gold standard weather simulation system - High-Resolution Forecast (HRES) produced by the ECMWF.

This model ingeniously uses recursively regular icosahedra for six iterations, generating polyhedra that replace the original Earth latitude and longitude network. Under the same resolution conditions, the number of graph model nodes decreases from one million (1,038,240) to 40,000 (40,962). This allows the model to learn complex data with large-scale multi-features under the GNN framework.

Figure 1: Model Structure

In addition to weather forecasting, GraphCast can open up new directions for other important geographical spatiotemporal forecasting problems, including climate and ecology, energy, agriculture, human and biological activities, and other complex dynamic systems. A learning simulator trained on rich real-world data will play a crucial role in advancing the role of machine learning in physical sciences.

## III. Run GraphCast in a New Environment

### 1. Configure the Machine

1. Power on your machine. Here, we demonstrate using AutoDL's RTX 2080 Ti 11GB. The machine comes pre-installed with the deep learning framework: JAX / 0.3.10 / 3.8 (ubuntu18.04) / Cuda 11.1.

   ![Insert Image Description Here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/direct/70244410e1354069866bea5d68fafaed.png#pic_center)

2. If you are using your own machine, ensure that JAX / 0.3.10 / 3.8 (ubuntu18.04) / Cuda 11.1 is pre-installed. GraphCast has not been tested on other versions.
3. If you are using AutoDL, open your preferred IDE, such as VsCode or PyCharm, or directly use AutoDL's provided JupyterLab. Here, we use VsCode and connect remotely to the server. Refer to **AutoDL Help Documentation/VSCode Remote Development** [https://www.autodl.com/docs/vscode/](https://www.autodl.com/docs/vscode/).

   ![Insert Image Description Here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/direct/a5b31c952a4c4bbcaa04e6c0d8eb8a8d.png#pic_center)

4. Configure VsCode.
    1. Install Python in VsCode's extensions, and VsCode will automatically install Pylance.

### 3. Download Data

1. The data here is provided by Google Cloud Bucket ([https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/dm_graphcast](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/dm_graphcast)). Model weights, normalization statistics, and example inputs can be found on the Google Cloud Bucket. To complete the model training, download the ERA5 dataset from ECMWF.
2. You are free to choose the data you want to test. Note that different data needs to match the model parameters. Here, we provide reference data used in this project:
